# Maturity
Evaluates the ontology's development progress and stability, considering factors such as version history, community uptake, and ongoing support. The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale can be used to assess its maturity.

## Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) for Ontology Development

- **TRL 1 — Basic Principles Observed:**  
  The ontology's foundational concepts and initial framework are identified and documented, but no formal structure or application has been developed yet.

- **TRL 2 — Technology Concept Formulated:**  
  The ontology's core concepts and relationships are defined and organized, establishing a preliminary structure and theoretical model.

- **TRL 3 — Experimental Proof of Concept:**  
  A prototype of the ontology is created, demonstrating its feasibility and validity through initial experiments or case studies.

- **TRL 4 — Technology Validated in a Lab:**  
  The ontology is tested in a controlled environment, verifying its functionality and accuracy with a specific dataset or use case.

- **TRL 5 — Technology Validated in a Relevant Environment:**  
  The ontology is applied in a relevant domain or real-world context, showing its effectiveness and adaptability in practical scenarios.

- **TRL 6 — Technology Demonstrated in a Relevant Environment:**  
  The ontology is demonstrated in a practical setting, showing its ability to integrate with existing systems and meet real-world needs.

- **TRL 7 — System Prototype Demonstration in an Operational Environment:**  
  The ontology is fully implemented and tested in an operational environment, proving its readiness for broader use and integration.

- **TRL 8 — System Complete and Qualified:**  
  The ontology is finalized, validated, and qualified for use across various applications, with documented evidence of its reliability and performance.

- **TRL 9 — Actual System Proven in an Operational Environment:**  
  The ontology is fully deployed and operational, demonstrating its proven effectiveness and stability in real-world applications, including large-scale or critical environments.
